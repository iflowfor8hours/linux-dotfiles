# vim: ft=conf
#
# In this config file, qutebrowser's key bindings are configured.
# The format looks like this:
#
# [keymode]
#
# command
#   keychain
#   keychain2
#   ...
#
# All blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.
# Inline-comments are not permitted.
#
# keymode is a comma separated list of modes in which the key binding should be
# active. If keymode starts with !, the key binding is active in all modes
# except the listed modes.
#
# For special keys (can't be part of a keychain), enclose them in `<`...`>`.
# For modifiers, you can use either `-` or `+` as delimiters, and these names:
#
#  * Control: `Control`, `Ctrl`
#  * Meta:    `Meta`, `Windows`, `Mod4`
#  * Alt:     `Alt`, `Mod1`
#  * Shift:   `Shift`
#
# For simple keys (no `<>`-signs), a capital letter means the key is pressed
# with Shift. For special keys (with `<>`-signs), you need to explicitly add
# `Shift-` to match a key pressed with shift.  You can bind multiple commands
# by separating them with `;;`.
#
# Note that default keybindings are always bound, and need to be explicitly
# unbound if you wish to remove them:
#
# <unbound>
#   keychain
#   keychain2
#   ...
